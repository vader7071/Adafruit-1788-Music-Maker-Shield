# Adafruit-1788-Music-Maker-Shield
Some demo code for the Adafruit 1788 Music Maker Shield showing how to do different files, and how to use an array to access multiple files easily

Copy the MP3 files to your FAT32 formatted SD card
Load the sketch on your Arduino.  This sketch is designed to be used with the shield, *NOT* the breakout board.

The sketch will play random sound files for 20 cycles then stop.
